        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Based in South London, our classes explore yoga through engaging themes, adventures, activities and poses
            that support children’s physical, emotional, social and intellectual development. Each child’s unique
            abilities are welcomed and encouraged in a non-competitive and happy environment.
            <br> <br>We use breathing and relaxation exercises to help children become calm and mindful in the busy and
            sometimes stressful world they live in. <br> <br>
            Our children build self-confidence, connect with each other using partner and group poses, develop important
            social skills – all while learning to love themselves.
            <br><br> Mini Mindful Children’s yoga is run by a fully-trained teacher with over eight years’ primary and
            special needs experience. We work closely with local nurseries and primary schools to provide high quality
            yoga sessions and after-school clubs. </p>

        <h1 class="about-emma">Emma</h1>

        <p>Emma has over eight years’ experience as a qualified primary and early years teacher and has been practicing
            yoga herself for many years. <br> <br>
            During her time working in challenging inner city schools, Emma began to explore yoga in her classroom by
            introducing breathing exercises. She immediately noticed the positive effect these had on the children’s
            ability to manage emotions, focus on their learning and feel calm and relaxed.
            <br><br>Mini Mindful allows her to combine her passion for working with young children with her love of yoga
            and its benefits for health and wellbeing.
            Emma qualified as a children’s yoga instructor with <a href="https://www.yogabeez.com"
